### Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸŽ“ Recent graduate from <a href=https://www.hackyourfuture.net>HackYourFuture</a> in the Netherlands, a 7-month coding bootcamp that covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MySQL, and ReactJS. I'm now well-prepared to embark on a journey as a full-stack developer and actively seeking opportunities for an internship or a junior role.

ðŸ’» Besides coding, my educational background includes a Technical Diploma in Accounting from the University of Aleppo. 

ðŸ“š On a continuous learning path, I'm also an IELTS Academic Certificate holder with an overall band score of 6.5 from the British Language Training Centre in the Netherlands.

ðŸŽµ When I'm not coding, I'm into music. I've been a rapper since 2008 and enjoy playing musical instruments. You can check out my music on my <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@luminousshade>youtube channel</a>.

Feel free to explore my projects, and let's connect to discuss coding, music, or anything interesting!
